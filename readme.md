qcumber-api
===========


Note: If you're looking for the easy to use course catalogue for Queen's University, you came close! This is the normalized filestructure database the powers it. You'll want to head over to http://qcumber.ca for the end-user site :)

Note also! Work in progress, not live yet. The current live site code is at http://github.com/ChrisCooper/QcumberD


consumes [qcumber data](https://github.com/Queens-Hacks/qcumber-data) and denormalizes/transforms it into endpoints that are nice to work with. It powers the main qcumber UI, and makes it easy for anyone to make a course wiki or something that wants to hook in with the catalog.
